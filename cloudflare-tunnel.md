# Cloudflare Tunnel

I have a Raspberry Pi running at home. I usually connect via an overlay network like Tailscale. But enabling tailscale VPN on my phone consumes too much battery.

I found [a video][1] explaining Cloudflare Tunnels on YouTube. Maybe I could use this insted?

This might also solve my root CNAME problem (using cloudflare nameservers instead of ovh).
